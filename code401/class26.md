# Component Based UI

* Component UI Systems like React, Angular and Vue got similar architectural principles.

1. The application is a composition of **components** that work together.
2. It depends on how they work together.
3. Classes and functions are used to classify functionality.
4. Require only what is needed.
5. Render it where we want it.
6. Keep an eye on **state** and react as it changes.

# React

* React is a javascript library, and it's used here to learn the basics of component based systems.

* React is a component based system that does a lot for us, it makes it easy to implement the application the way you see it using familiar tools.

# JSX

* JSX is a syntax extention to Javascript and it's used with react, for example the following code is JSX `const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;`

* We use JSX because it combines both markup and javascript, so we have markup and logic in the same place.

* JSX prevents injection attacks so it's safe to embed user input in JSX.

# SASS 

* Sass is a powerfyk professional grade CSS extention language.

* Because stylesheets are getting larger and more complex, sass gives features like nesting, variables, inheritance and other features that does not exist in css yet.
