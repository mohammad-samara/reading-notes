## Solving Programming Problems

### Common mistakes

* Most programmers try to solve a problem by writing code instantly, which is wrong.

* You can beat that mistake by following these steps, you must use 70% of your time in steps 1 to 3:

1-Read the problem twice.

You must understand the problem even if it takes you to read multiple times.

2-Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

Try to solve it using your own logic.

3-Optimize the manual steps.

Try to refactor the manual steps into as less steps as you can.

4-Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

Writing comments and psuedo code to capture all the steps we created and put them inside the code editor.

5-Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

Now get to implement what you wrote into real code.

6-Optimize the real code.

Refactor it as much as you can.

## Act like you make $1000/hr

* Most people value their time less than they actually are, so don't waste your time doing things like watching low quality TV and social media when you can use that time for something productive.

* Imagine what will you do if you value your time as 1000$ per hour, what will your life look like?
* What people would you stop putting up with? What problems would you stop wasting time on? What things would you stop — and start — doing?

* Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.

## How to think like a programmer

* In order to think like a programmer, you must follow these steps:

1- Understand: Know exactly what is being asked, most hard problems are hard because you don't understand them.

2- Plan: Draw a plan before you start execution as it will help you in organizing your thoughts and steps.

3- Divide: Don't try to solve a big problem in one go, instead seperate the big problem into smaller problems that you can solve independently.

4- Stuck? It's okay, it happens to everyone, you should go step by step in your solution to try to find the problem.

5- Practice: Don't expect to be great very fast, the more practice you put the more things you can solve easily.
