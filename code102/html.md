# HTML

### Hello my name is mohammad samara and I will share with you what I have learnt about HTML.

#### html is used to make a structure to the text of the web pages by using heading and subheading to make it easier to read.

### html uses elements to describe the structure of pages.

  * element is a 2 tags plus what is between them like this: < p >text< /p >
  * element tells the browser information about the text between the two tags.
  * a tag is the combination of left-angle bracket,a character,and RIGHT -angle bracket like this < a >

**atributes** appear in the oppenig tag and tells us more about elements
**EX:** < p lang="en-us" >

## I will next explain the use of some of the attributes:

1. ID: to identify single element from the other element
2. class: to identify several element from the other element

## IFRAMES
- An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.
- One common use of iframes is to embed a Google Map into a page by typing the next code:
< iframe
width="450"
height="350"
src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=moma+new+york
&amp ;output=embed">
</ iframe>
